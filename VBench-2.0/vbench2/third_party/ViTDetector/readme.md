# Human Anomaly Dataset and Training Framework

This part provides an open-source dataset and training framework for Human Anomaly Detection.
---

## Data Structure

The dataset and related resources are organized as follows:

```
VBench-2.0_human_anomaly_root/
├── dataset/                # Main directory for the image dataset
│   ├── all_images.zip      # Compressed file containing all images
│   ├── face_train.jsonl    # Face training set annotations
│   ├── face_test.jsonl     # Face testing set annotations
│   ├── hand_train.jsonl    # Hand training set annotations
│   ├── hand_test.jsonl     # Hand testing set annotations
│   ├── human_train.jsonl   # Human training set annotations
│   ├── human_test.jsonl    # Human testing set annotations
├── src_video/              # Raw video data used to construct the dataset
│   ├── CogVideo/           # Videos generated by CogVideoX-1.5
│   ├── CogVideo-1.0/       # Videos generated by CogVideoX-1.0
│   ├── vad_real/           # Real-world videos
```

Each JSONL file contains annotations for the corresponding images. Each line in the JSONL file represents a single sample in the following format:
```json
["image_filename.jpg", label, score]
```

- `image_filename.jpg`: The base name of the image file.
- `label`: The ground truth label (e.g., class or pose information).
- `score`: Confidence score (unused).

## Framework

### Data Pre-processing for training and inference

- We first use YOLO-World as the open-vocaburary detector to detect the human in each frame, then detect the face and hand from the croped human image. The detection threshold is set to 0.1.
- To meet the input size requirement (square) of SimMIM, we extend the bounding boxes into square. 
- The human, face, hand will be saved to different folders for the following three anomaly detectors.
- We show the data processing pipeline below.

</p>

### Training Pipeline

- We utilize the pre-trained weight of SimMIM and finetune the whole network with an additional anomaly detector that consists of a MLP layer.
- For the anomaly score, 0 means the image is normal and 1 means the image is abnormal, we use the binary cross entropy loss.
- The human, human face and human hand anomaly detectors need to be trained separately, the higher the score, the more possible it is an anomaly.
- We show the training pipeline below.

</p>

### Inference Pipeline

- Given a generated video, we do frame-wise anomaly detection.
- Firstly, we detect and crop the human, human face and hand by YOLO-World as shown in ``data pre-processing`` in each frame.
- Then the detected image will be fed into corresponding anomaly detector with different anomaly threshold (i.e., 0.45, 0.3, 0.32 for human, human face, and human hands respectively).
- For each frame, we calculate the average score of the anomaly score of each human (sometimes there is more than one person in the frame). 
- For each human, it is flagged as abnormal if any of the three models predict an anomaly and the score will be 0, otherwise 1.

## How to Train

### Prerequisites
- Follow VBench2.0 environment set-up

### Steps to Train

1. **Download Pre-trained Model**:
   - Download the pre-trained SimMIM model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dJn6GYkwMIcoP3zqOEyW1_iQfpBi8UOw/view?usp=sharing)
   - Download the pre-trained YOLO-World model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qo-K1kum7yiEwIlN1TWDvABXX6qriUen/view?usp=drive_link)
   - put the models into `pretrain/`
   - or use the following command:
   ```bash
   gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1dJn6GYkwMIcoP3zqOEyW1_iQfpBi8UOw -O pretrain/
   gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qo-K1kum7yiEwIlN1TWDvABXX6qriUen -O pretrain/
   ```

2. **Download Dataset**:
   - Download the dataset files from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_NyiLa861EbDQdDp4Lsy4jTzH2ynCiFw?usp=drive_link) or the following URL:
     ```bash
     git clone https://huggingface.co/datasets/Vchitect/VBench-2.0_human_anomaly
     ```
   - If the large folder does not download, use the following command (You need to configure Git LFS in advance, or we suggest using the Google Drive link above.):
      ```bash
      cd "VBench-2.0_human_anomaly"
      git lfs install
      git lfs pull
     ```

3. **Extract Images**:
   - Unzip the `opensource.zip` file:
      ```bash
      cd "VBench-2.0_human_anomaly"
      zip -s 0 --out merged.zip "opensource.zip"
      unzip merged.zip
      mv opensource/* ./
      rm -rf opensource
      rm merged.zip
      rm opensource.*
      ```

4. **Run Training**:
   - Execute the training code (we take face detector training as an example, for human and hand detectors, change the corresponding names):
     ```python
     torchrun --master_port 15690 main_finetune.py \
      --cfg 'configs/vit_base__800ep/simmim_finetune__vit_base__img224__800ep.yaml' \
      --train-path "VBench-2.0_human_anomaly/dataset/face_train.jsonl" \
      --val-path "VBench-2.0_human_anomaly/dataset/face_test.jsonl" \
      --pretrained 'pretrain/simmim_pretrain__vit_base__img224__800ep.pth' \
      --batch-size 128 \
      --output "checkpoint/face"
     ```


5. **Run Inference**:
   - Note that you need to train all of the three detectors to run the inference code (By default, we train for 30 epochs):
    ```python
    python inference.py \
      --cfg 'configs/vit_base__800ep/simmim_finetune__vit_base__img224__800ep.yaml' \
      --detector_config 'third_party/YOLO-World/yolo_world_v2_xl_vlpan_bn_2e-3_100e_4x8gpus_obj365v1_goldg_train_lvis_minival.py' \
      --detector_weights 'pretrain/yolo_world_v2_xl_obj365v1_goldg_cc3mlite_pretrain-5daf1395.pth' \
      --human_model 'checkpoint/human/ckpt29.pth' \
      --face_model 'checkpoint/face/ckpt29.pth' \
      --hand_model 'checkpoint/hand/ckpt29.pth' 
    ```

### Notes
- Ensure that all paths in the JSONL files correctly point to the extracted images.
- Modify the configuration file (`config.yaml` or similar) if you wish to customize training parameters.
