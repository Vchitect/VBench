The camera moves forward into a narrow alley, where the darkness at the end feels overwhelming, with broken signs and yellowed wallpaper, as if remnants of another time. The street is empty, with only the occasional wind blowing paper and leaves. As the camera moves deeper, the air grows heavier, and faint details appear in the shadows: old wires hanging from the walls and rusted doorframes swaying slightly. Finally, the camera pulls back, showing the entire street enveloped in stillness, with the flickering neon lights almost mocking the emptiness and desolation.
The camera starts at a rusted metal gate, with peeling paint revealing dull metal underneath, giving a sense of decay and unease. The gate creaks open, and the camera moves into a dimly lit corridor, with cracked tiles on the floor and exposed concrete in places. The light at the far end of the hallway is faint, creating an eerie atmosphere. As the camera moves forward, bloodstains on the walls become evident, and the air smells of mold and decay. The camera enters a former patient room, where the bed is torn apart, broken curtains flutter, and through the shattered window, an abandoned courtyard can be seen. The camera moves with the wind, and a low, mournful moan fills the room, as if the restless souls of former patients are trapped inside. As the camera shifts to the doorway, the outside is engulfed in darkness, and the air grows heavier, with the sound of footsteps echoing down the hollow hallway, as though someone is silently following. Finally, the camera pulls back, showing the entire abandoned asylum being swallowed by darkness, leaving behind an oppressive feeling of isolation and suffocation.
